algorithms
==========

A project which can save your time and organize your code on the way learning algorithms.

### What will you get?
    For learners with Java programming experience:
        You can save your time on creating project or editing only one class over and over agian.
    For total new Java learners:
        Besides the time-saving you will get above, you can learn a little bit about Extending, Implementing, Thread, Event, Generic, Abstract Class, and Interface, by cracking my code.

### How to open this project?
    You should open this project in IntelliJ IDEA. Get IDEA: http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/.
    However, you may convert the project to the format which can be opened by Eclipse by yourself.

### How to use it?
    Create your own class implementing algorithm, then extend the BaseAlgorithm and implement the IAlgorithm.
