algorithms
==========

A project which can save your time and organize your code on the way learning algorithms.

### How to open this project?
    You should open this project in IntelliJ IDEA. Get IDEA: http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/.
    However, you may convert the project to the format of Eclipse by yourself.

### How to use it?
    Create your own class implementing algorithm, then extend the BaseAlgorithm and implement the IAlgorithm.

### How does it work?

### What will you get?
    For learners with programming experience, you can save your time on creating project or editing only one class over and over agian.
    For total new Java learners, besides the time-saving above, you can learn a little bit about Extending, Implementing, Thread, Event, Generic, Abstract Class, and Interface, by cracking my code.
